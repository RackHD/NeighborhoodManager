<p>The <a href="https://github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/tree/master/registry">Service Registry</a> is a utility that will listen on the network for services that advertise themselves. The specific list of services a user would like to be notified about is configurable. When an advertisement is seen on the network from a configured service, the Service Registry collects information about the service, and registers the details with a storage backend of the user's choosing. Other applications can access this storage for aggregated information about all services available on a given network.</p>
