## Service Registry
The [Service Registry] is a utility that will listen on the network for services that advertise themselves. The specific list of services a user would like to be notified about is configurable. When an advertisement is seen on the network from a configured service, the Service Registry collects information about the service, and registers the details with a storage backend of the user's choosing. Other applications can access this storage for aggregated information about all services available on a given network.

## RackHD Proxy
The [RackHD Proxy] is a utility that acts as a proxy to the RackHD API.

<p>We’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
