The specific list of services a user would like to be notified about is configurable. When an advertisement is seen on the network from a configured service, the Service Registry collects information about the service, and registers the details with a storage backend of the user's choosing. Other applications can access this storage for aggregated information about all services available on a given network.\r\n\r\n## RackHD Proxy [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/rackhd?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/rackhd)\r\nThe [RackHD Proxy] is a utility that acts as a proxy to the RackHD API.\r\n\r\n## Libreg [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/libreg?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/libreg)\r\n\r\n[Libreg] is an abstraction library to interface with a backend datastore.  Currently supports Consul.\r\n\r\n[Service Registry]: https://github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/tree/master/registry\r\n[RackHD Proxy]: https://github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/tree/master/rackhd\r\n[Libreg]: https://github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/tree/master/libreg\r\n\r\n![](https://github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager/blob/gh-pages/NM_02OCT2016-1.png)\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis project is written in golang and some commands in the documentation assume a working go installation.\r\n\r\nThis project also uses docker and for those commands we assume the latest docker version is installed.\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNeighborhood Manager is a collection of libraries and applications housed at https://github.com/RackHD/neighborhood-manager.
